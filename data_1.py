=================================================

Data Science:
-------------
- A broad, multidisciplinary field.
- Focuses on asking new, strategic questions.
- Extracts knowledge from large, complex datasets.
- Creates predictive models using advanced machine learning and AI.
- Goal: Predict future outcomes and enable data-driven systems.

Data Analysis:

--------------
- A narrower discipline within Data Science.
- Focuses on examining existing, often structured, data.
- Answers specific, immediate business questions.
- Provides actionable insights from past events.
- Uses tools like SQL, Excel, and visualization software.
- Goal: Understand and interpret past data to support current decisions.

Summary:
--------
- Data Science = Looks forward (predicts and innovates).
- Data Analysis = Looks backward (interprets and explains).

Example:
--------
- Data Science = Identify which customers are likely to leave (churn) so the company can 
  take action to retain them.
- Data Analysis = Find why sales dropped last quarter by analyzing the sales data.
